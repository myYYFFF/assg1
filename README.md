Name of the projhect: Vita tech
Set in the future, where the ability to create prosthetics has become a reality, my company specializes in the research, development, and production of prosthetic devices aimed at enhancing human life and supporting individuals with disabilities, offering services to those in need.
The website is clean and professional, conveying to visitors that our services and technology are both precise and expertly crafted. Its simplicity, without excessive decoration, reinforces our trustworthy image.

DESIGN PROCESS
The cyan-blue color choice is inspired by the tones commonly found in modern cyberpunk works. This color evokes a sense of the future and is closely associated with technology. As a result, the website’s color scheme primarily features shades of cyan and light blue. The only other color used is black, which symbolizes elegance, mystery, and sophistication. The contrast between the high brightness of cyan and the near-black darkness creates a bold visual impact, capturing the viewer's attention while adding an air of refinement and luxury.

The reason for selecting the animated image on the homepage is that its movement is subtle, or rather, very graceful. The floating speed is smooth and consistent, and when paired with the black background, it creates a sense of mystery while also conveying stability and reliability.The two lines of text at the center of the screen: the first line displays the company name, and the second line clearly articulates our mission — to enhance human life and drive innovation for a better future.

The background on the product page features an animated eye for a very specific reason. Our products are customized based on the client's needs and physical condition, so closely observing and understanding every aspect of their requirements is crucial. The eye symbolizes our dedication to paying close attention to our clients. As with the rest of the site, the color choice remains blue, or cyan, with smooth and consistent motion to maintain a gentle and refined feel.

The final page features an animation resembling the exhaust flame of an engine, viewed vertically. The large movement and fast speed symbolize our strong desire for potential clients with needs to reach out to us. It encourages them to share their requirements and challenges, with the swift and dramatic motion subtly urging them to take action immediately.
